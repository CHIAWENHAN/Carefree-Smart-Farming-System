# Carefree-Smart-Farming-System

Utilize the Free Blynk IoT Platform to create an Urban Lifestyle carefree smart farming system Dashboard


# Prototype Features
1. Smart monitoring mobile apps
- Blynk mobile apps will be installed on every customer’s smartphone
- show the soil humidity, fertilizer level and allow control to some features such as switching off the pest control feature at night.
2. Carefree and minimal maintenance  
- only minimal maintenance which is refilling the fertilizer container once a month and replenishing the big water tank when it is out of water. 
3. Efficient water supply
- Water only will be supplied to the soil by using a pump when the sensor detects the soil moisture less than 45%
4. High Frequency Bird/ Insect Sound Repeller   
- When there is some motion or obstacle in front of the infrared sensor, the system will automatically emit the high frequency buzzer sound to get rid of the bird.
5. Rain and temperature detection
- Rain and temperature sensor is installed at the system to detect parameter changes and notify the user through the mobile application.

An authentication token by the master is needed to become co-develop the dashboard.

# Challenge
Unstable internet connection due to hardware and cost limitation

# What's Next
"Data is just like crude. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used." - Michael Palmer
- The data can be used to develop machine learning model to find out the suitable irrigation periods and temperatures for certain urban crops.
- Use of establish cloud service provider to development of IoT backend.
